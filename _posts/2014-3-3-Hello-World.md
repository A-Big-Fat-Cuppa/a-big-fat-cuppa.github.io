I’ve been back and forth, back and forth for years with trying to set up a blog. I received a lot of positive feedback over my first blog back in 2011-2012, a blog designed to initially tell everyone what abuse I was experiencing and keeping loved ones updated about what was going on with me when I was living in refuges. I ended up closing that one down and saving my pages as I was told in Germany that I effectively had to stay silent. I stayed silent for 11 years. Whilst I tried to post the odd post every now and then, I always ended up taking them down after getting crippling panic attacks after each post, brought on by being told I couldn’t talk about what I was experiencing. In the last few years, I lost my confidence and self-worth and this only made it harder to write. I don’t want to live in silence any more. I want 2026 to be the year I rediscover my voice and my love for writing, whether that blogs, journals or creatively. I don’t want to worry any more about what others might think of me or the judgements that might be made. I honestly don’t know why I ever did. I thought you were supposed to care less as you got older. I’m not here for anyone’s sympathy or apologies, I simply want to write and share my journey with any one who wants to read it. If you want to talk to me about it, that’s absolutely ok. If you do want to tag along, I suggest making yourself comfy, grabbing a big cuppa because my posts are generally loooooong, and having a tissue or two ready at hand because I know, if some of them make me cry, they’ll probably make you cry, too. 
Anyway, I really appreciate you for reading these posts. It actually means a lot to me to have friends who support me on my rather complicated journey in life. #

So thank you. So much.
Love

Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
