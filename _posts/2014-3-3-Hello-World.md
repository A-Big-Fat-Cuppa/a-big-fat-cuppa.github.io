I've been thinking about continuing with a blog for some time now. I've started and stopped, started and stopped, because the truth is, I'm scared. Scared to show how vulnerable I really am, deep down, behind all the smiles and laughs and the very strong exterior. Every time I've gone to publish a post, I've been instantly hit with a panic attack, caused by the overwhelming thought of what others would think of me and how I would be judged. I genuinely don't know why any of that ever mattered, it never used to, but I have also, in recent years, lost a lot of my confidence and self-worth. I want 2026 to be the year where I am unafraid, unapologetic, and where I don't care what may or may not be said about me or my situation. It's not about how many likes or who reads this. It's my story, my life, my wounds from many years of secret battles. I want it up and out there for any one who wants to read it. I was silenced for 11 years. I want to find my voice again. Regardless of what it's about. And if you'll join me, I'd suggest making yourself comfy and grabbing a cuppa, because my blog posts are loooooong. You might need a tissue or two. I don't need anyone's sympathy or apologies, but I could do with a friend or two :) . I hope you'll tag along for the ride. It's a crazy one.
Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
